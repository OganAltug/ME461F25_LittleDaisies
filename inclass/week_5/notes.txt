1 - Yeterince hızlı okumaktansa hangi hızda yazdığın önemli.

2 - It has to be repeatable for creating perfectly periodic signal waves.

3 - General Purpose Input Output / Programmable Input Output

4 - Polling is constantly asking

5 - Interrupt service routine , called when interrupt happen

6 - 1 to 0 or 0 to 1 is a toggle event.

7 - If button pressed, it freezes the actual code and isr block executed. After 
that it continiue to the main code.

8 - first in first out is queue, last in first out, first in last out is stack

9 - due to the continious interrupt it becomes stack overflow. Pico will be froze.

10 - falling interrupt, rising interrupt, changing interrupt,
GPIO interrupt, timer interrupt, register interrupt

11 - We can interrupt the interrupt to intervene the pico to freeze

12 - We may loose data when we interrupt the interrupt

13 - We will make an ENCODER. Design will be ours.

14 - If your code interrupted to much, it would be better useing PIO pins. They
are faster.

15 - PICO microchip - RP24

16 - If you change bits, it is called masking

17 - In datasheets what register do what explained well.

18 - How can we change bits in bytes.

19 - If there is a pin and a bar above it, it implies if selected it is zero. 
Otherwise it is HIGH.

20 - Half of bite is nibelling. With 4 bits we can define hexadecimal address.

21 - PIN communicates with each other. To syncronize the pins we need other pin.
That called clock pin.

22 - With the clock it is syncronize communication, without the clock it is 
asyncronize communication.

23 - We will write our own communication protocol.

24 - SHort presentation on sampling problem. Sampling theorem sais that 2 sample
in every period.
